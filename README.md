# glTF modular library (based on C, A-type)

A-type based glTF schema and parser â€” designed to load `.gltf` files directly into strongly-typed model structures, independent of any rendering or graphics subsystem.

### ðŸ’¡ features
- fully declarative A-type class schema for all glTF core types  
- parses GLTF JSON into usable C data structures  
- supports materials, animations, meshes, accessors, buffers, nodes, and transforms  
- works standalone without any dependency on rendering systems (e.g. Vulkan, Metal, DirectX, OpenGL)

### ðŸ“¦ usage

```c
#include <import>

int main(int argc, cstr argv[]) {
    A_start();

    path gltf = path("models/orbiter.gltf");
    Model orbiter = read(gltf, typeid(Model));
}
```
this loads `orbiter.gltf` into a fully resolved `Model` class with access to nodes, skins, meshes, materials, etc.

for more information, check out orbiter & trinity's use of this object; there we use a Vulkan subsystem to render this model.

whatever object we define, we may serialize in and out of json. 'Model' is simply one case of this

A-type is a general object model capable of being a very node-like experience for C.  it is a meta
object model capable of high performance reflection in C, and uniquely capable of modern development.

### ðŸ“¦ building (identical for all C-based, A-type libraries)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ar-visions/A
git clone https://github.com/ar-visions/gltf
cd gltf
mkdir build
make -f ../Makefile
```

### ðŸš€ setting up our import file for your own A-type project (use-case: orbiter)

```import
A	https://github.com/ar-visions/A	main
vec	https://github.com/ar-visions/vec	main
gltf https://github.com/ar-visions/gltf main
trinity	https://github.com/ar-visions/trinity	main

app:
	A vec gltf trinity
	linux:
		asound

```

we may debug any one of these modules by setting 'DBG' environment variable:
```sh
export DBG="*,gltf,trinity,*"
export SRC="/home/user/src"
```
simply set to ones you wish to debug, and A-type import will compile for debug ... 
also useful to setup your SRC directory so import may look here and symlink rather than checkout git ... this A-type import pattern improves general software development practices for all libraries.
